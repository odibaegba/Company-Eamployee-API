2024-08-14 11:37:15.6895 ERROR Something went wrong: Type 'Shared.DataTransferObjects.CompanyDto' cannot be serialized. Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute attribute, and marking all of its members you want serialized with the DataMemberAttribute attribute. Alternatively, you can ensure that the type is public and has a parameterless constructor - all public members of the type will then be serialized, and no attributes will be required.
